# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The iOS app is failing to build for device deployment with architecture-related errors. The Flutter framework binary contains only arm64 architecture but the build process expects multiple architectures (arm64 x86_64). This prevents successful archiving and deployment to physical iOS devices. We need to resolve these architecture mismatches and ensure proper device build configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to successfully build and archive the iOS app for device deployment, so that I can distribute the app to physical devices and the App Store.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for iOS device THEN the Flutter framework SHALL contain the correct architectures for the target build
2. WHEN running archive build THEN the build process SHALL complete without architecture-related errors
3. IF architecture mismatches occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Flutter framework configuration, so that device builds work consistently across different build configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for Release configuration THEN the Flutter framework SHALL be properly configured for device-only architectures
2. WHEN the build system processes the Flutter framework THEN it SHALL handle architecture requirements correctly
3. IF framework architecture issues occur THEN automated fixes SHALL be available

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable build scripts and validation, so that I can quickly identify and resolve architecture-related build issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN architecture issues are detected THEN diagnostic tools SHALL identify the specific problem
2. WHEN running build validation THEN the system SHALL verify framework architecture compatibility
3. IF manual intervention is needed THEN clear step-by-step instructions SHALL be provided
