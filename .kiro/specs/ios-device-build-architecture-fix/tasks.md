# Implementation Plan

- [ ] 1. Create architecture detection and validation utilities
  - Write shell script to detect current build target (device vs simulator)
  - Implement function to validate Flutter framework architectures using lipo
  - Create utility to check current Xcode project architecture settings
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 2. Fix Xcode project architecture configuration
- [ ] 2.1 Update device build architecture settings
  - Modify ARCHS setting in project.pbxproj for device builds to use only "arm64"
  - Update VALID_ARCHS setting to match device requirements
  - Ensure Release configuration is properly set for device deployment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1_

- [ ] 2.2 Preserve simulator build compatibility
  - Maintain correct architecture settings for simulator builds
  - Implement conditional architecture settings based on build target
  - Validate that simulator builds continue to work after changes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 2.3 Update build configuration consistency
  - Ensure Debug, Release, and Profile configurations have consistent architecture settings
  - Remove any conflicting EXCLUDED_ARCHS settings that might interfere
  - Validate all build configurations work correctly
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [ ] 3. Implement Flutter framework cleanup and rebuild
- [ ] 3.1 Create framework validation script
  - Write script to check Flutter framework architecture using lipo -info
  - Implement detection of corrupted or incomplete framework binaries
  - Create diagnostic output for framework architecture issues
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.2, 3.1_

- [ ] 3.2 Implement framework rebuild process
  - Create script to clean Flutter build cache and framework
  - Implement forced rebuild of Flutter framework for device target
  - Add validation that rebuilt framework contains correct architectures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Create automated build fix script
- [ ] 4.1 Implement comprehensive build fixer
  - Write master script that combines architecture fixes and framework rebuild
  - Add automatic detection of build issues and appropriate fixes
  - Implement rollback capability in case fixes cause other issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4.2 Add build validation and testing
  - Create script to test device build after applying fixes
  - Implement validation that archive process completes successfully
  - Add checks for common post-fix issues
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 3.1_

- [ ]* 4.3 Create automated test suite for build scenarios
  - Write tests for different architecture configurations
  - Test recovery from various framework corruption states
  - Validate fixes work across different Xcode versions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_

- [ ] 5. Create diagnostic and troubleshooting tools
- [ ] 5.1 Implement build diagnostics script
  - Create comprehensive diagnostic tool for iOS build issues
  - Add architecture analysis and framework inspection capabilities
  - Implement clear reporting of detected issues and recommended fixes
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 5.2 Create troubleshooting documentation
  - Write step-by-step guide for manual architecture issue resolution
  - Document common architecture-related build problems and solutions
  - Provide diagnostic commands and their interpretation
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.3_
