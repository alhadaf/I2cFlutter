# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The iOS app is failing to launch on the simulator with error "The request was denied by service delegate (SBMainWorkspace)". This is a common issue that can be caused by bundle identifier conflicts, simulator state issues, or build configuration problems. We need to systematically resolve these issues to ensure reliable app launching.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the iOS app to launch successfully on the simulator, so that I can test and debug the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built and launched on iOS simulator THEN the app SHALL start without service delegate errors
2. WHEN using `flutter run` command THEN the app SHALL launch on the default simulator successfully
3. IF the simulator is in an inconsistent state THEN the system SHALL provide clear recovery steps

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a proper bundle identifier configuration, so that there are no conflicts with system services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is configured THEN the bundle identifier SHALL NOT use the generic "com.example" prefix
2. WHEN the bundle identifier is changed THEN all related configuration files SHALL be updated consistently
3. IF there are bundle identifier conflicts THEN the system SHALL resolve them automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want reliable build and launch scripts, so that I can quickly recover from simulator issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN simulator issues occur THEN automated recovery scripts SHALL be available
2. WHEN running recovery scripts THEN they SHALL clean simulator state and rebuild the app
3. IF manual intervention is needed THEN clear step-by-step instructions SHALL be provided
