# iOS App Store Upload Fix - "devices relationship required" Error

## Problem

When attempting to upload the iOS app archive to App Store Connect, you encounter:

```
Apple error: The relationship 'devices' is required but was not provided with this request.
```

## Root Cause

This error typically occurs in one of these scenarios:

1. **Missing Provisioning Profile**: The archive was built without a proper provisioning profile
2. **Development Build Instead of Distribution**: The archive was created with a development certificate instead of a distribution certificate
3. **App Store Connect API Issue**: The upload tool (Transporter, Xcode Organizer, or altool) is missing required metadata
4. **Incomplete App Registration**: The app hasn't been properly registered in App Store Connect

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Verify Build Configuration

#### Step 1: Check Code Signing Settings in Xcode

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Select the **Runner** target
3. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
4. For **Release** configuration:
   - ✅ Uncheck "Automatically manage signing"
   - Select **App Store Distribution** provisioning profile
   - Select **iOS Distribution** certificate

#### Step 2: Create Proper Archive

1. In Xcode, select **Any iOS Device** (not a simulator or specific device)
2. Go to **Product → Archive**
3. Wait for the archive to complete
4. The Organizer window will open automatically

#### Step 3: Validate Before Upload

1. In Organizer, select your archive
2. Click **Validate App** (not Distribute App yet)
3. Choose **App Store Connect** distribution method
4. Select your team
5. Let it validate - this will catch issues before upload

### Solution 2: Fix Archive for App Store Distribution

If you're using command-line tools or getting this error:

#### Check Current Export Options

Create an `ExportOptions.plist` file in `ios/` directory:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>app-store</string>
    <key>destination</key>
    <string>upload</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
    <key>provisioningProfiles</key>
    <dict>
        <key>com.i2c.joinmeister</key>
        <string>YOUR_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_NAME</string>
    </dict>
    <key>signingStyle</key>
    <string>manual</string>
    <key>uploadSymbols</key>
    <true/>
    <key>compileBitcode</key>
    <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

**Important**: Replace:
- `YOUR_TEAM_ID` with your Apple Developer Team ID (found in App Store Connect)
- `YOUR_PROVISIONING_PROFILE_NAME` with your App Store provisioning profile name
- `com.i2c.joinmeister` with your actual bundle identifier if different

#### Export Archive with Correct Options

```bash
cd ios

# Create archive
xcodebuild archive \
  -workspace Runner.xcworkspace \
  -scheme Runner \
  -configuration Release \
  -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive

# Export IPA for App Store
xcodebuild -exportArchive \
  -archivePath build/Runner.xcarchive \
  -exportOptionsPlist ExportOptions.plist \
  -exportPath build/Runner-IPA
```

### Solution 3: Using Flutter Build Commands

#### Correct Flutter Build Command

```bash
# Build iOS app (creates archive)
flutter build ipa

# The IPA will be in: build/ios/ipa/
```

If you get the "devices" error, it means the build didn't use the correct provisioning profile.

#### Fix Provisioning in Flutter Build

1. Open `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` in Xcode
2. Configure signing as described in Solution 1
3. Close Xcode
4. Run again:
   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   flutter build ipa
   ```

### Solution 4: App Store Connect Setup

Ensure your app is properly set up in App Store Connect:

#### Step 1: Register App in App Store Connect

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Click **My Apps**
3. Click **+** button → **New App**
4. Fill in:
   - **Platform**: iOS
   - **Name**: Event Checkin Mobile
   - **Primary Language**: English
   - **Bundle ID**: Select `com.i2c.joinmeister`
   - **SKU**: A unique identifier (e.g., `event-checkin-mobile-001`)
   - **User Access**: Full Access

#### Step 2: Create App Store Version

1. Select your app
2. Click **+ Version or Platform** → **iOS**
3. Enter version number: `1.0.0`
4. Fill in all required metadata:
   - Screenshots
   - Description
   - Keywords
   - Support URL
   - Marketing URL (optional)
   - Privacy Policy URL

#### Step 3: Create Provisioning Profile

1. Go to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account)
2. Navigate to **Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles**
3. Click **Profiles** → **+** button
4. Select **App Store** distribution
5. Select your App ID: `com.i2c.joinmeister`
6. Select your distribution certificate
7. Download the provisioning profile
8. Double-click to install it

### Solution 5: Using Transporter App

If uploading manually via Transporter:

1. Download [Transporter app](https://apps.apple.com/app/transporter/id1450874784)
2. Build your IPA with correct provisioning (see Solution 2)
3. Open Transporter
4. Drag and drop the IPA file
5. Click **Deliver**

The Transporter app will show clearer error messages if there are issues.

### Solution 6: Verify Bundle Identifier

Ensure your bundle identifier matches across all places:

#### Check 1: Xcode Project
```
ios/Runner.xcodeproj → Target → General → Bundle Identifier
Should be: com.i2c.joinmeister
```

#### Check 2: Info.plist
```
ios/Runner/Info.plist → CFBundleIdentifier
Should be: $(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)
```

#### Check 3: App Store Connect
```
Your app in App Store Connect → App Information → Bundle ID
Should be: com.i2c.joinmeister
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ **Building with simulator selected** - Always select "Any iOS Device"
2. ❌ **Using development certificate** - Must use distribution certificate for App Store
3. ❌ **Ad Hoc provisioning profile** - Must use App Store provisioning profile
4. ❌ **Automatic signing for distribution** - Use manual signing with correct profiles
5. ❌ **Uploading from simulator build** - Simulator builds can't be uploaded

## Recommended Upload Method (Easiest)

### Using Xcode Organizer (Most Reliable)

1. **Build Archive**:
   ```bash
   # Clean first
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install && cd ..
   
   # Open in Xcode
   open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. **In Xcode**:
   - Select **Any iOS Device** (or a connected device, not simulator)
   - Menu: **Product → Archive**
   - Wait for archive to complete

3. **Upload**:
   - Organizer opens automatically
   - Select your archive
   - Click **Distribute App**
   - Choose **App Store Connect**
   - Follow the wizard

This method handles all the "devices" relationship metadata automatically.

## Verification Steps

After applying fixes, verify:

1. ✅ Archive built for "Generic iOS Device" (not simulator)
2. ✅ Uses iOS Distribution certificate
3. ✅ Uses App Store provisioning profile
4. ✅ App registered in App Store Connect
5. ✅ Bundle ID matches everywhere
6. ✅ Version number is higher than any previous uploads

## Alternative: Using Fastlane (Advanced)

If you want to automate uploads:

```bash
# Install fastlane
sudo gem install fastlane

# Initialize fastlane in ios directory
cd ios
fastlane init

# Create a lane for upload
# Edit ios/fastlane/Fastfile
```

Example Fastfile:
```ruby
lane :upload do
  build_app(
    workspace: "Runner.xcworkspace",
    scheme: "Runner",
    export_method: "app-store"
  )
  upload_to_app_store(
    skip_metadata: true,
    skip_screenshots: true
  )
end
```
