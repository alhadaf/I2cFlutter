# iOS Device Build Architecture Fix

## Problem

When attempting to build/archive the iOS app for device deployment, the build failed with the following error:

```
Target release_unpack_ios failed: Exception: Binary Flutter.framework/Flutter does not contain architectures "arm64 x86_64".

lipo -info:
Non-fat file: Flutter.framework/Flutter is architecture: arm64
```

Additionally, CocoaPods reported a consistency issue:
```
[Xcodeproj] Consistency issue: build setting `ARCHS` has multiple values:
{"Debug" => "arm64 x86_64", "Release" => "arm64", "Profile" => "arm64"}
```

## Root Cause

The Xcode project was configured with inconsistent architecture settings across different build configurations:
- **Debug**: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"` and `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"`
- **Release**: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"` and `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"`
- **Profile**: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"` and `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64"`

However, Flutter only builds the framework for the target platform's architecture:
- **Device builds**: Flutter produces `arm64` only
- **Simulator builds**: Flutter produces `arm64` and `x86_64`

When building for device (archiving), the project expected both architectures but Flutter only provided `arm64`, causing the build to fail.

## Solution

Removed the explicit `ARCHS` and `VALID_ARCHS` settings from all build configurations in `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`. This allows Xcode to:
1. Inherit architecture settings from the system defaults
2. Use the architecture settings from Flutter's generated xcconfig files
3. Build only for the appropriate architecture based on the target platform

### Changes Made

Modified `ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj`:

**Debug Configuration (97C147061CF9000F007C117D):**
- Removed: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`
- Removed: `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`

**Release Configuration (97C147071CF9000F007C117D):**
- Removed: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`
- Removed: `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`

**Profile Configuration (249021D4217E4FDB00AE95B9):**
- Removed: `ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`
- Removed: `VALID_ARCHS = "arm64 x86_64";`

## How Flutter Manages Architectures

Flutter's generated `ios/Flutter/Generated.xcconfig` contains:
```
EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphonesimulator*]=i386 arm64
EXCLUDED_ARCHS[sdk=iphoneos*]=armv7
```

This configuration:
- For **simulator builds**: Excludes `i386` and `arm64`, allowing `x86_64` (and arm64 for Apple Silicon Macs)
- For **device builds**: Excludes `armv7`, allowing `arm64`

By removing explicit `ARCHS` settings, Xcode now properly inherits these exclusions and builds for the correct architecture based on the target platform.

## Next Steps (Run on macOS)

1. **Clean the build folder:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   rm -rf Pods/ Podfile.lock
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   ```

2. **Reinstall dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Test the build:**
   - For simulator: `flutter run` (should work as before)
   - For device archive: Build via Xcode → Product → Archive

4. **Verify the archive:**
   - The archive should complete successfully
   - The Flutter framework should only contain `arm64` architecture
   - No architecture mismatch errors should occur

## Expected Behavior

After these fixes:
- ✅ Simulator builds will use appropriate architectures (`x86_64` for Intel, `arm64` for Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Device builds will use `arm64` only
- ✅ Archive builds for App Store distribution will succeed
- ✅ CocoaPods will not report consistency errors
- ✅ The "Thin Binary" script will work correctly

## Additional Notes

- The `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH` setting is kept as:
  - `YES` for Debug (faster builds during development)
  - `NO` for Release and Profile (ensures all architectures are built for distribution)

- This fix maintains compatibility with:
  - iOS devices (arm64)
  - iOS Simulator on Intel Macs (x86_64)
  - iOS Simulator on Apple Silicon Macs (arm64)
