# Codemagic Setup - Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What Was Just Fixed

Your `codemagic.yaml` configuration file has been:
- ‚úÖ Created with proper iOS App Store build configuration
- ‚úÖ Committed to your repository
- ‚úÖ Pushed to GitHub (alhadaf/I2cFlutter)

**The error "Failed to install dependencies for pubspec file in /Users/builder/clone. Directory was not found" should now be resolved!**

---

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete Setup

### Step 1: Trigger a New Build in Codemagic

The build that just failed was using the old configuration (before `codemagic.yaml` existed). Now that the configuration is pushed, you need to trigger a new build:

**Option A: Automatic Trigger**
- Make any small change and push (or just trigger manually)

**Option B: Manual Trigger from Codemagic Dashboard**
1. Go to https://codemagic.io
2. Select your project (I2cFlutter)
3. Click **Start new build**
4. Select workflow: `ios-release`
5. Click **Start build**

### Step 2: Add Your Encrypted API Keys

The build will proceed further but will need your encrypted keys. You need to update these lines in `codemagic.yaml`:

**Line 13:** `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY: Encrypted(...)`  
**Line 14:** `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY: Encrypted(...)`

**How to get encrypted values:**

#### Method 1: Use Codemagic UI (Easiest)
1. Go to Codemagic ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí Environment variables
2. Add variable: `APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Paste your App Store Connect API key content
   - ‚úÖ Check "Secure"
3. Add variable: `CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY`
   - Enter your certificate password
   - ‚úÖ Check "Secure"
4. **Remove lines 13-14 from codemagic.yaml** - the variables will be available from the UI

#### Method 2: Use Codemagic CLI
```bash
# Install CLI
pip3 install codemagic-cli-tools

# Get your App Store Connect private key
# (It's the .p8 file you downloaded from Apple Developer)
cat ~/path/to/AuthKey_6Y8XL8Q783.p8

# Encrypt it
codemagic-cli-tools encrypt APP_STORE_CONNECT_PRIVATE_KEY "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

# Encrypt certificate password
codemagic-cli-tools encrypt CERTIFICATE_PRIVATE_KEY "your-cert-password"
```

Then update `codemagic.yaml` with the encrypted values.

### Step 3: Update Email Address

Edit `codemagic.yaml` line 51:
```yaml
recipients:
  - your-email@example.com  # ‚Üê Change this to your actual email
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
cd /home/alex/Pictures/i2c/app
git add codemagic.yaml
git commit -m "Update Codemagic email notification"
git push origin master
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Update TestFlight Beta Groups

If you have specific TestFlight beta groups, update lines 60-62:
```yaml
beta_groups:
  - "Your Beta Group Name"  # Update with actual names from App Store Connect
```

Or remove these lines if you don't need beta testing yet.

## üìä What Will Happen on Next Build

When you trigger the next build, Codemagic will:

1. ‚úÖ Clone your repository to `/Users/builder/clone`
2. ‚úÖ Find `pubspec.yaml` at the root (no more "Directory was not found" error!)
3. ‚úÖ Run `flutter pub get` successfully
4. ‚úÖ Install CocoaPods dependencies
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Attempt to fetch code signing (will need your encrypted keys)
6. ‚ö†Ô∏è Build IPA (will need proper signing)
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Upload to TestFlight (will need App Store Connect integration)

---

## üîç Expected Build Output

### Before (Current Failed Build)
```
== Install Flutter dependencies ==
Build failed :|
Failed to install dependencies for pubspec file in /Users/builder/clone. Directory was not found
```

### After (With codemagic.yaml)
```
== Install Flutter dependencies ==
Running "flutter pub get" in clone...
Resolving dependencies...
Got dependencies!

== Install CocoaPods dependencies ==
Installing pod dependencies...
Pod installation complete!

== Build IPA ==
Building iOS app...
```

## üõ†Ô∏è If Build Still Fails

### Issue: Still Getting "Directory was not found"
**Solution:** Make sure you triggered a **new build** after pushing `codemagic.yaml`. Old builds won't pick up the new configuration.

### Issue: Code Signing Errors
**Solution:** Add your encrypted API keys (see Step 2 above)

### Issue: "No provisioning profile found"
**Solution:** Configure App Store Connect integration in Codemagic:
1. Go to Teams ‚Üí Integrations ‚Üí App Store Connect
2. Add credentials:
   - Issuer ID: `9b6f8519-694d-48a5-8b90-cd6c1debe0d3`
   - Key ID: `6Y8XL8Q783`
   - Private Key: Upload your `.p8` file

### Issue: Build Timeout
**Solution:** Increase `max_build_duration` in `codemagic.yaml` (currently set to 120 minutes)

## üéØ Quick Checklist

- [x] Create `codemagic.yaml` configuration
- [x] Commit and push to GitHub
- [ ] Trigger new build in Codemagic
- [ ] Add encrypted API keys (or use Codemagic UI variables)
- [ ] Update email address in config
- [ ] Configure App Store Connect integration
- [ ] Review successful build logs
- [ ] Test TestFlight distribution

- **Your Repository:** https://github.com/alhadaf/I2cFlutter

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Environment Variables:** Instead of hardcoding secrets in `codemagic.yaml`, use Codemagic's Environment Variables feature (more secure)

2. **Test Locally First:** Before relying on CI/CD, make sure the build works locally:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install
   flutter build ipa --release
   ```

3. **Monitor Build Logs:** Always check the full build logs in Codemagic to understand any issues

4. **Incremental Fixes:** Don't try to fix everything at once. First get dependencies installing, then fix signing, then fix publishing.

---

## ‚ú® Summary

**Problem:** Codemagic couldn't find the Flutter project  
**Root Cause:** No `codemagic.yaml` configuration file  
**Solution:** Created and pushed proper configuration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for next build attempt  

**Your next build should successfully install Flutter dependencies!** üéâ

The remaining work is just adding your API keys and configuring App Store Connect integration for the signing and publishing steps.
